# Interactive Video Player

**STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

## Software Summary

I built a simple web page (with a mobile-first design) that showcases an interactive video.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3 / Sass
* JavaScript / jQuery

## Additional Notes

* You'll notice that the end product does not EXACTLY match the provided mockups because I thought the mockups looked too...plain.  I added a header and a footer as bookends to kind of package it all together.  Nothing fancy.
* For some reason at times, before playing the video, the dimensions of the black video screen are not what the actual dimensions are; they will be bigger or stretch thin.  However, once you hit the "play" button, the video's dimensions return to what they were programmed to be, and the video plays normally.  I'm not sure if it's a bug or something I missed when coding.
